# Computer_Vision-Food_Vision
A Python project powered by TensorFlow for food recognition using computer vision techniques.

# Food Vision with Python and TensorFlow

This project is a demonstration of food recognition using computer vision techniques. It's implemented in Python, making use of the powerful TensorFlow library. 

Dataset: food101

## Introduction

Computer vision has a wide range of applications, and one exciting area is food recognition. This project showcases my ability to create a robust food recognition system using Python and TensorFlow. It can be a valuable addition to your computer vision projects, whether you're exploring the world of deep learning or food identification.

## Features

- Food item recognition: The system is capable of identifying and classifying various food items.
- Python and TensorFlow: The project is implemented in Python and leverages the TensorFlow library for machine learning and deep learning tasks.
- Easy to use: You can use and customize this project for your specific food recognition needs.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required Python libraries and dependencies.
4. Run the food recognition script.
